# AI-Based Electricity Demand Projection System

## Overview

This project, developed for the Smart India Hackathon 2024, aims to revolutionize electricity demand forecasting and management using advanced AI techniques. By combining the power of machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning, we have created a robust system capable of highly accurate predictions and real-time optimizations.
